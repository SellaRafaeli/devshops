We started nowcast because we think live interactive video programs are really cool. They can help people make a living doing what they love and sharing it with anyone, anywhere. You can make video programs on nowcast and either donate the revenue to charity or use it to buy shiny or delicious stuff. 🙂

Live interactive videos offer so many exciting new opportunities that it feels like the Internet is becoming “real”. Live video programs have more in common  with real life than with static or even dynamic websites. This is the future we've been waiting for! ;)

We are super excited to see the various kinds of live video programs people create. We currently have yoga teachers, programming trainers, improv comedy, cooking shows, English teachers, meditation classes, fashion advice, social games - you get the idea. It’s anything you used to do in person, before the COVID-19 lockdown times.

This is just the beginning; live interactive video offers new possibilities that we can’t guess yet - but we bet it’s going to be awesome. 🙂
