Hello, world: nowcast now has a blog. 
</p>

<p>We did it DIY because that is how we do everything we can. It supports HTML, is rendered on the server, and is deeply integrated with the rest of the system. We expect this to help us strongly connect our blog content directly to our creators, for example by link such as our <a href='/yoga'>yoga</a> vertical or our <a href='/jobs'>page</a>. Not that this would impossible with an external, even white-labeled blogging platform, but it looks much better when we actually own our stack and tools as much as we can. We can record views, stylize it the way we want it, and so on. Some say hunger is the best spice; we say the best spice is doing things with love.</p>



<p> We really appreciate you reading this and being with us. Please reach out to us if you want to collaborate. Life's short, let's make art. </p>
