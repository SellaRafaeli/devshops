The original language of these Terms of Service, as well as all other texts throughout the Site, is English. Nowcast makes available translations for convenience only. In case of conflicts between the original English version and any translation, the English version shall prevail.

“Casts” are video services offered via NowCast, for free or for a payment, via live video. Casts can be either singular or recurring events.

Payment Services Provider(s) are service providers that provide payment services to "Buyers" and "Sellers" in connection with NowCast, including with respect to collection of funds from Buyers in connection with purchases, remittance and withdrawal of funds to Sellers.

Revenue is money that Sellers earn from Casts and other services.

Sellers are users who offer and perform services through live videos (Casts/NowCasts), streamed either on NowCast or on other sites and platforms.

Overview: (Main terms, in a nutshell)
=========

Only registered users may buy and sell on Nowcast. Registration is free and can be done alongside payment.

Casts on NowCast may be offered at a base starting price of $1, or for free. Some Casts are offered at a base price of more than $1 as determined by the Seller.

Buyers pay Seller via Nowcast in advance in order to receive access to a Seller’s Cast (see Purchasing Section below regarding payment terms). NowCast is not responsible for ensuring Seller will supply services as promised. However, in case of a dispute regarding a Seller's fulfillment of a commitment to a cast as scheduled or any other reason, NowCast reserves the right to refund customers and/or withhold payment to a Seller, in proportion to the funds lost or damage incurred to a customer. NowCast reserves the right to be the final arbiter of any and all financial disagreements or disagreements of any other nature.

For fees and payments please read the purchasing section.

Sellers must fulfill their scheduled and purchased Casts, and may not cancel Casts on a regular basis or without cause. Cancelling Çasts will affect Sellers’ reputation and status. NowCast reserves the right to refund customers and/or otherwise withhold payment to Sellers if sellers do not reasonably show up to their Casts. 

Sellers gain account statuses and attributes based on their performance and reputation, which may provide their owners with benefits, including offering services for higher prices and additional software abilities.

NowCast discourages sellers from offering or accepting payments using methods external to the NowCast platform. 

We care about your privacy; please read our Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is a part of these Terms of Service and incorporated herein by reference.

Users undertake to comply with NowCast’s Community Standards, which are a set of behavior rules and guidelines, applicable to the NowCast community and marketplace in addition to these Terms of Service, as updated from time to time.


Payment and purchasing
======================

Basics
======
Sellers create and schedule listings of Casts on NowCast to allow Buyers to purchase their services.

Sellers may also offer custom Casts to Buyers in addition to their scheduled casts. 

Money made by ticket sales to Casts or other sales by Seller via NowCast accredits a Seller's account with a net revenue of 80% of the purchase amount minus processing fees, to be paid out once a month via US bank transfer or via Paypal. The remaining 20% are used to cover Nowcast's operating costs. Nowcast's operating costs do not include any fees incurred during the remittance of funds to buyer.

In order to pay sellers the amount due, NowCast will, when relevant, contact sellers via the email on their account, informing them of the amount due and asking for an invoice for this amount, billed to NowCast. The invoice shall include all details necessary to send the money. NowCast supports bank transfers within the United States and Israel, and Paypal in the rest of the world. NowCast reserves the right to employ a Know-Your-Customer procedure before issuing payouts, in compliance with regulatory KYC practices around the world. 

The minimum amount to receive a payout is 100$. NowCast accredits Sellers once every calendar month, providing the net payout following all processing fee deductions is above the minimum amount, and against an invoice sent by the seller to NowCast billing NowCast the amount due and containing the information necessary to send a payment. Ensuring NowCast has received adequate invoice and account details in order to perform remittance in a timely and correct manner shall be the responsibility of the seller. NowCast reserves the right to postpone payment for as long as necessary in case of missing information or any other reason.

If a Cast is cancelled (for any reason), NowCast does not take responsibility for reimbursing buyers. Such responsibility may be found with the Seller directly. 

For security concerns, NowCast may temporarily delay paying a Seller, to prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported by Buyers, or associating multiple NowCast accounts to a single target withdrawal provider.

Sellers are responsible for paying any direct or indirect taxes, including any GST, VAT or otherwise, which may apply to them depending on residency or location. Sellers represent and warrant that they comply, and will comply at all times, with their obligations under income tax provisions in their jurisdiction. The price shown on a NowCast page is inclusive of all such taxes and charges that may apply to the Sellers.

Appointment as Limited Payment Collection Agent: Seller hereby appoints NowCast as Seller’s limited authorized payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting payments (via its Payment Services Provider, if applicable) from Buyer, and remitting those payments to Seller. 

Seller agrees that payment from Buyer to NowCast shall be considered the same as payment made directly to Seller. Buyer’s payment obligation to Seller will be satisfied upon receipt of payment by NowCast (or its Payment Services Provider, as applicable), and NowCast (via its Payment Services Provider, as applicable) is responsible for remitting the funds to the Seller in the manner described in these Terms of Service. In the event that NowCast (via Payment Services Provider) does not remit any such amounts to Seller, the Seller will have recourse only against NowCast and not the Buyer directly. Seller agrees that NowCast may describe or otherwise reflect the terms contained herein in any terms of service, receipts, disclosures, or notices including, but not limited to, receipts provided to Buyers that NowCast may deem necessary or prudent.

NowCast partners with Payment Services Providers for purposes of collecting payments from Buyers and transferring such payments from Buyers to Sellers. All payments services in connection with the withdrawal of funds on the NowCast platform are performed by NowCast’s Payment Services Providers.

Sellers are responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts that are sufficient to cover all risks associated with the performance of their services.
