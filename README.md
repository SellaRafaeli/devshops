Septmber goals: 

1. Get paid as tutor
	- make videos explaining:
		- What I teach. 

1. Hi, my name is Sella Rafaeli and I can teach you to code online. 

I am an extremely experienced programmer specializing in what is known as frontend and fullstack development, which allows building web sites and applications such as gmail, facebook, or airbnb. 

Coding is one of the best skills you can learn for your career, whether you want to be a software engineer, entrepreneur, graphic designer, product manager, or anyone who works in tech. And now you can learn these skills directly with live teachers giving you private tutoring at your own pace and preference. 

Nowcast is a marketplace for such teachers. On Nowcast we have many teachers and schools competing for your business. I personally teach on Nowcast, and my personal classes have a policy of Satisfaction Guaranteed or your money back. I am confident enough in my ability to teach you that I am willing to take the risk. If you are not satisfied you will get a 100% refund.

To learn how to code, all you need is a laptop, an Internet connection, and a lot of motivation and determination. You don't need a college degree, you don't need to be good at math. You will need to work hard, and for long stretches of time. It helps immensely to have a mentor, a coach, a teacher that can help you and guide you along the way. It's your journey and nobody can take it for you, but some people can show you the way. I am one of those people. 

If you are serious about getting started you should contact me, for example at hi@nowcast.co. Tell me a bit about yourself, what you're trying to achieve, and any other important details. I tailor my teaching to your level, prior knowledge, and schedule. The focus is on teaching you how to code, from zero to as far as you want to go. 

Video notes:
1. I am an experienced developer.
2. Coding is a very valuable skill
3. Nowcast is a marketplace for people who teach coding and tech skills
4. You will benefit immensely from a private teacher.
5. You should contact us. 
6. If you also teach online, you should definitely contact us, so I can help you find students. 



2. Pay as client
	- make video saying what I am looking for. 

Learn to Code Online with Live Classes. 

3. Match paying client and seller
	- student and teacher for development 
	Tzlil should find students by posting together on social media:
		- Digital Nomads: "Hi! Does anyone want to learn coding remotely?"

Message to buyers:
	* Learn anything with personal live interactive online video classes. 

Message to team:
	* "Live Creators" are Creators that use live video for business, such as online teachers or entertainers. We are betting on them (as business and entertainment move to the cloud) and we want their long-term business, so we want to give them value. What they want are software tools that will help their business, which is based around live video. 

	So:
		1. We will create SEO'd listings for them so they can get more traffic (Google).
		2. We will create SEO'd indexes, lists of these guys, so the entire list gets more traffic (Yahoo). 
		3. We will create a broadcasting schedule for live creators all over the world. 
	
	And so our main business goal is:
	* List of businesses that have or can have video programming, helps them get found by new clients.

	We will then:
	* Help with billing (sell tickets for video shows by special, subscription, or sponsorship) and take a cut of each (like Patreon).
	* Upsell services for businesses that have video programming (billing, subscriber management, chat, fancy livestream experience, promotion in internal search results)
	* Enable community reviews (Yelp)

	3. NowCast Gold: 
	* NowCast as a new concept, a new type of show, live interactive video program. Good for PR. Live Interactive Internet TV (LIIT). For serious creators that want a custom, top-tier experience that makes them look like a million bucks. 

Message to self:
	* Isn't this amazing? We're having so much fucking fun.
