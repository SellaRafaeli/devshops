GoodWeed - A Cannabis e-Commerce Business Platform for Ambitious 

We're an Israeli-American (SF) startup developing an all-in-one online platform for cannabis e-commerce and operations management: a White-Label Cannabis Marketplace & CRM. 

We are comparing options for the right cannabis business with whom to integrate our product, tech and team, to increase efficiency of operations and sales, and provide the R&D firepower for an industry leader. 

If one of your portfolio companies at American Growth Fund could benefit from owning a strong online platform, I'd be happy to explore further; please email me so we can move forward.
